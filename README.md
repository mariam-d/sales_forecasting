Data analysis of a grocery store

DataSet : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data

Problem Statement :
In the retailer industry, grocery stores are always in a delicate dance with purchasing and sales forecasting. With a little higher prediction, grocers might be stuck with overstocked, perishable goods; however, with a little lower guess, popular items will quickly sell out, and thus leaving money on the table. This prediction problem becomes more important and complex as retailers plan to add new locations with unique needs, new products, and unpredictable product marketing. Considering the comprehensive data on Corporación Favorita, we decided on this grocery corporation as the predicting target.

Purpose and Objectives :
We analyzed grocery sales data from Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer .
